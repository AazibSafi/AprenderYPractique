A "Past Due Suppression" offer is defined in terms of a start date, the number of payment cycles for which it applies,
the direction in time (counting forwards from the start date or backwards), and whether the payment cycle containing the start date is included.

Customer data arrives in the form of a list of past payment cycles, each flagged with whether payment was past-due or not.

Your program must transform input to turn off, or suppress, the "past due" flag as appropriate to the input Past Due Suppression offer
